# DITA Sample Doc Site

On GitHub, you can host your technical documentation site for free. By hosting your site on GitHub, you get versioning/track changes. You can also easily invite contributions from other stakeholders, such as developers and product management.

# Steps:
1) Sign up for GitHub, if you already are not.
2) Create a repository for your technical content. https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo 
3) Upload your content. Ensure that an index.html file is present in the root of your repository to serve as the home page of the documentation website. 
4) Go to the settings of the repository.
5) In settings, scroll to GitHub Pages and enable it for your site. The GitHub Pages area will give you the public URL for your website. Make a note of it. 
6) If required choose a theme and Save. 
7) To use GitHub desktop for version control/tracking the changes, download and install it. Then in the browser, go to the repository and select Clone or Download > Open In Desktop. Now you can open the copy of your GitHub repository locally, make changes to the files and commit the changes to Git.
